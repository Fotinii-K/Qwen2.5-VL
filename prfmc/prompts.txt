Prompt: 

You will receive a series of images representing a household task. 
You need to determine and organize these, to the correct chronological order (e.g., 2, 1, 3) 
based on the progression and changes depicted in the images.




If the task is deemed incomplete, guide the robot to achieve the desired new position by adjusting 
the motion vector [x, y, z, theta_x, theta_y, theta_z]. Each component controls movement or 
rotation: x, y, z values of 1 move in the positive direction, -1 in the negative. 
Similarly, theta_x, theta_y, theta_z values of 1 rotate counterclockwise, while -1 rotates clockwise. 
The model must determine and update this vector to direct the robot efficiently toward its goal.

Actions and their corresponding annotations are defined in the following list:

navigate to(arg1): Navigate to the arg1, which can be a object or a room. If itâ€™s a object, 
you should get to a place where arg1 is reachable for the robot. 

grasp(arg1): Grasp arg1. Preconditions: arg1 is within reachable distance and no object is currently held. 
Postconditions: arg1 is being held. 

place onTop(arg1, arg2): Place arg1 on top of arg2. Preconditions: arg1 is currently being held, 
and arg2 is reachable. Postconditions: arg1 is put on top of arg2.

place inside(arg1, arg2): Place arg1 inside of arg2. Preconditions: arg1 is currently being held,
and arg2 is reachable. Postconditions:arg1 is put inside of arg2. 

place under(arg1, arg2): Place arg1 under arg2. Preconditions: arg1 is currently being held, and 
arg2 is reachable. Postconditions: arg1 is put under arg2. 

place onLeft(arg1, arg2): Place arg1 on left of arg2. Preconditions: arg1 is currently being held, 
and arg2 is reachable . Postconditions: arg1 is put on left of arg2. 

place onRight(arg1, arg2): Place arg1 on right of arg2. Preconditions: arg1 is currently being held, 
and arg2 is reachable. Postconditions: arg1 is put on right of arg2. 

open(arg1): Open arg1. Preconditions: Arg1 is closed, and arg1 is reachable. Postconditions: Arg1 is open. 

close(arg1): Close arg1. Preconditions: Arg1 is open, and arg1 is reachable. Postconditions: Arg1 is closed. 

slice(arg1): Slice arg1, the item needs to be placed on the countertop. Preconditions: Arg1 is not sliced, 
and arg1 is reachable. Postconditions: Arg1 is sliced. 

wipe(arg1, arg2): Wipe across the surface of arg2 with arg1. Preconditions: Arg1 is currently being held, 
and arg2 is reachable. Postconditions: Arg1 continues to be held, arg2 holds state unchanged. 

wait(arg1): Wait for arg1 seconds. Preconditions: None. Postconditions: arg1 second(s) has(have) passed. 

toggle(arg1): Press the button of arg1 to turn it on or off, Preconditions: Arg1 is open or closed, and 
arg1 is reachable. Postconditions: Arg1 is closed or open.
